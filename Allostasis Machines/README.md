#### Allostasis as dynamics.

What shifts systems to new homeostatic states (set points)?

1) anomalous diffusion.

2) phase transitions, or difference between i) recoverable allostatic load (recovery) and ii) hysteretic allostatic load (shift).

#### Allostatic drive as differentiation.

1) learn-unlearn-relearn (switching) as induction of allostatic drive.

2) tree representation of states, as a map between stable homeostatic states (internal models) and external switches.

#### How does a network of neurons respond to a stressor?

1) perceptual agent (nearest-neighbor influence). Behaves like a nerve net, cellular automata.

2) stressor can increase or decrease the sensitivity of each cell, so that "load" propagates across the cell array in different ways.
