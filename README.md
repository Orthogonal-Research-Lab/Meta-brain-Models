Meta-brain models are hybrid models that include both a representation-free component and a representation-rich component. As we can see from the diagram above, this relationship mimics the neocortical-thalamic system relationship of the mammalian brain, and can be made spatially explicit (the representation-rich component can "encase" or be "layered" on top of the representation-free component).

Examples of a representation-free model includes Braitenberg Vehicles or Neural Networks. Examples of a representation-rich model (from our library) includes Contextual Geometric Structures or Ideological Connectionist models. We have a library of possible model configurations, or incorporate your own! 

This project involves three aims: creating models with different degrees of representational complexity, creating a layered meta-architecture that mimics the structural and functional heterogeneity of biological brains, and an input/output methodology that is flexible enough to input/output methodology that is flexible enough to accommodate both behavioral and social phenomena.
